WooCommerce Dropshippers is a WordPress plugin that makes your e-commerce dropshipper-ready. No more compromises, no more tentative solutions, this is the one and only fully functional dropshipping platform for WooCommerce!
With WooCommerce Dropshippers an administrator can assign to an user the custom role of “Dropshipper”. Once the role is assigned to the user, the administrator can assign products to him/her. That’s it!
